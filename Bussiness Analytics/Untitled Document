Data Processing : every operation works on NaN only so we need to convert all othe values like na & Not Avaliable to NaN.
Functions Used to Converted unwanted  values into NaN values.
Find out all the column with mean value. Slice it .and store it in a varaible say x
Apply imputer on that x, by replacing it by mean or medium mentioning it in “startery=”
.Values used when you want to convert it into ndarray
If the array contains only one feaature he fita and transform will giv you error. So to convert them into 2D array.use x.reshape(-1,1) if it has one feature and when it has single value then x.reshape(-1,1)

Changing Categorical Data:
LabelEncoder : will convert categorical data into numercial data.
OneHotenCoder:

fromsklearn.prepocessing import LabelEncoder,OneHotEncoder

label_coder_x=LabelEncoder()
